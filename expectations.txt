My expectations:
- Learn and master the basics of web development that I will be needing for backend and frontend web development
- Improve my web designing and thinking skills
- Become proficient at Git
- Learn how to collaborate properly and work as a team with other developers

Feedback from Yosef:
    I agree with your expectations, Michael! Especially when it comes to not only becoming better web developers, 
    but also becoming better teammates and peers with other developers!
